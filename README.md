- There is nothing special, I am just an old beginner(?) discord bot programmer on Javascript. 
- I was a master at discord.js v12 but i can't say that about node.js.
- So i am currently trying to learn about almost all necessary things about node.js.
- I and my friend @Evils7 made a verified(early verified actually) bot named Rvein.
- Right now i am coding nothing but my partner is coding and upgrading Rvein still.
- You can take a look at Rvein on https://top.gg/tr/bot/683366408092254275
